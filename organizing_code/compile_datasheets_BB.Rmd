## Load and Clean Data   

NOTE: All date data should be standardized prior to importing into R. In Excel, set format to YYYY-MM-DD for consistency. Unfortunately, this process in Excel will auto-populate the year (when not already present) based on system settings. For germination data, this means that the year should be corrected to 2021!!


NOTE 2: All paths are relative thanks to the 'here' package.  


NOTE 3: Two iterations of a maternal family ID (names fixed before saving csv):
**BB_205_A** occurs at locations 33, 99, and 154 and has Donor BB_217 (greenhouse cohort 5)
**BB_205_B** occurs at locations 48, 96, and 126 and has Donor BB_188 (cohort 6)


**Germination Data**  
- Add 'Date Sown' column and data in as well.

**Flower Check sheets**  
-- Organize flowering data
-- Do not trust the fitness plant data in the flowering check data sheets (add in later).  

*Important Step!!*  
In the csv file, select all data with dates (visit dates, leaf sampling, and flower photos). Right click --> format cells. Select the date category --> YYYY-MM-DD. Save the csv and close it. This will standardize all dates to the same format and make working with them in R much easier!

**Fruit and Seed counts**  

Due to the structure of excel data sheets, it seems easiest to upload fruit and seed count data separately since different spreadsheets were used to record each. Info on plants' Block, Transect, sequence, etc. will be pulled from the fruit count sheets (assumed to be up-to-date). For sheets intended to record fruit production only, counts of viable seeds, mean seed weight, etc. that are copied over are ignored and instead pulled straight from sheets where they were first entered later on. 

Data on fitness plants will be more accurate in the fruit-cound data sheet, while the seed-count sheet will have a handful of rows with non-fitness plants wihtout seed counts.

Date added: **Feb 06, 2023** 

*NOTE*: Update with later versions of data sheet when more seed counts have been entered
```{r message = FALSE}
