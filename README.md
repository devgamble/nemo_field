# Nemophila menziesii Field Project

#### Mazer Lab 2020-2023

#### Summary

This repository contains data and R code for the Mazer lab *Nemophila menziesii* project evaluating Fisher's fundamental theorem and patterns of natural selection. The contents of this repository include data and code pertaining to the two-year field experiment conducted at four *N. menziesii* populations: Angelo Coast, Bodega Bay, Blue Oak Ranch, and Hastings reservation.


### Project Description/overview
2-3 par


### Project Use  
Up-to-date R and Rstudio software is recommended to view and run the code in this project (version info below). Most of the data analyzed were saved using Microsoft Excel and uploaded to R as .csv files. In each of the .Rmd files, R packages are called at the beginning of the document. When possible, file paths specified in functions such as `read_csv()` are relative using the "here" package. In several instances, .csv files were manipulated outside of the RStudio programming environment; these cases are annotated with comments within the .R or .Rmd files they are called.

### File Organization

Macro-structure
Folders within the project directory contain, for the most part, either data (D) on the individuals planted at each population or code (C) used to organize and analyze this data:

- analysis_code
- climate_data
- organizing_code
- data_sheets


Micro-structure
Each .Rmd file typically follows the same structure: packages/libraries are loaded at the top of the document, and are typically followed by a brief description of the document purpose. Data sheets may then be either created or read in from another folder within the repository.
